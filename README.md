👋 Hi, I’m Julian. I am an entry-level Java programmer, looking for my first programming job.
  
👀 I know basics of following technologies:
- Java
- SpringBoot
- Hibernate
- JDBC
- Git
- Intellij
- SpringWeb
- REST API
- Gradle
- Junit5, Mockito
- Swagger
- MySQL
- Thymeleaf
- Jira
- Selenium WebDriver

🌱 What I am doing now, is practice, practice, practice... :)

💞️ I'm looking for a frontend developer to collaborate on a portfolio web application. I am a graphic designer by profession, I can help in editing graphics if necessary.
